     * - If an update is available
     *         - If the update is mandatory and the alertMessage is set in options, the user will be informed that the application will be updated to the latest version.
     *           The update package will then be downloaded and applied.
     *         - If the update is not mandatory and the confirmMessage is set in options, the user will be asked if they want to update to the latest version.
     *           If they decline, the syncCallback will be invoked with SyncStatus.UPDATE_IGNORED.
     *         - Otherwise, the update package will be downloaded and applied with no user interaction.
     * - If no update is available on the server, or if a previously rolled back update is available and the ignoreFailedUpdates is set to true, the syncCallback will be invoked with the SyncStatus.UP_TO_DATE.
     * - If an error occurs during checking for update, downloading or installing it, the syncCallback will be invoked with the SyncStatus.ERROR.
     *
     * @param syncCallback Optional callback to be called with the status of the sync operation.
     * @param syncOptions Optional SyncOptions parameter configuring the behavior of the sync operation.
     * @param downloadProgress Optional callback invoked during the download process. It is called several times with one DownloadProgress parameter.
