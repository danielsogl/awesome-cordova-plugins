/**
 * @name WifiWizard2
 * @description
 * WifiWizard2 enables Wifi management for both Android and iOS applications within Cordova/Phonegap projects.
 *
 * This project is a fork of the WifiWizard plugin with fixes and updates, as well as patches taken from the Cordova Network Manager plugin.
 * @usage
 * ```typescript
 * import { WifiWizard2 } from '@awesome-cordova-plugins/wifi-wizard-2/ngx';
 *
 *
 * constructor(private wifiWizard2: WifiWizard2) { }
 *
 *
 * # Global Functions
 *  These are functions that can be used by both Android and iOS applications
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.getConnectedSSID()
 *  ```
 *  - Returns connected network SSID (only if connected) in success callback, otherwise fail callback will be called (if not connected or unable to retrieve)
 *  - This does **NOT** return the BSSID if unable to obtain SSID (like original WifiWizard did)
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.getConnectedBSSID()
 *  ```
 *  - Same as above, except BSSID (mac) is returned
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.timeout(delay)
 *  ```
 *  - `delay` should be time in milliseconds to delay
 *  - Helper async timeout delay, `delay` is optional, default is 2000ms = 2 seconds
 *  - This method always returns a resolved promise after the delay, it will never reject or throw an error
 *
 *  Example inside async function**
 *  ```typescript
 *  async function example(){
 *     await this.wifiWizard2.timeout(4000);
 *     // do something after 4 seconds
 * }
 *  ```
 *
 *  Example inside standard non-async function**
 *  ```typescript
 *  function example(){
 *     this.wifiWizard2.timeout(4000).then( function(){
 *         // do something after waiting 4 seconds
 *     }):
 * }
 *  ```
 *
 *  Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  - `TIMEOUT_WAITING_FOR_SCAN` on timeout waiting for scan 10 seconds +
 *  - `SCAN_FAILED` if unable to start scan
 *
 *  # iOS Functions
 *  For functionality, you need to note the following:
 *  - Connect/Disconnect only works for iOS11+
 *  - Can't run in the simulator so you need to attach an actual device when building with xCode
 *  - Will ensure 'HotspotConfiguration' and 'NetworkExtensions' capabilities are added to your xCode project
 *  - To connect to open network omit `ssidPassword` or call with `false`
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.iOSConnectNetwork(ssid, ssidPassword)
 *  ```
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.iOSDisconnectNetwork(ssid)
 *  ```
 *
 *  # Android Functions
 *  - **WifiWizard2** *will automagically try to enable WiFi if it's disabled when calling any android related methods that require WiFi to be enabled*
 *
 *  ## Connect vs Enable
 *  When writing Android Java code, there is no `connect` methods, you basically either `enable` or `disable` a network. In the original versions of WifiWizard the `connect` method would basically just call `enable` in Android.
 *  I have changed the way this works in WifiWizard2 version 3.0.0+, converting it to a helper method to eliminate having to call `formatWifiConfig` then `add` and then `enable` ... the `connect` method will now automatically call `formatWifiConfig`, then call `add` to either add or update the network configuration, and then call `enable`.
 *  If the connect method is unable to update existing network configuration (added by user or other apps), but there is a valid network ID, it will still attempt to enable that network ID.
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.connect(ssid, bindAll, password, algorithm, isHiddenSSID)
 *  ```
 *  - `ssid` should be the SSID to connect to *required*
 *  - `bindAll` should be set to `true` to tell Android to route all connections from your Android app, through the wifi connection (default is `false`) *optional*
 *  - See `WifiWizard2.enable` for more details regarding `bindAll` feature
 *  - `algorithm` and `password` is not required if connecting to an open network
 *  - Currently `WPA` and `WEP` are only supported algorithms
 *  - For `WPA2` just pass `WPA` as the algorithm
 *  - Set `isHiddenSSID` to `true` if the network you're connecting to is hidden
 *  - These arguments are the same as for `formatWifiConfig`
 *  - This method essentially calls `formatWifiConfig` then `add` then `enable`
 *  - If unable to update network configuration (was added by user or other app), but a valid network ID exists, this method will still attempt to enable the network
 *  - Promise will not be returned until method has verified that connection to WiFi was in completed state (waits up to 60 seconds)
 *
 *  Thrown Errors**
 *
 *
 *  - `CONNECT_FAILED_TIMEOUT` unable to verify connection, timed out after 60 seconds
 *  - `INVALID_NETWORK_ID_TO_CONNECT` Unable to connect based on generated wifi config
 *  - `INTERPUT_EXCEPT_WHILE_CONNECTING` Interupt exception while waiting for connection
 *
 *
 *
 *  ## Disconnect vs Disable
 *  Same as above for Connect vs Enable, except in this situation, `disconnect` will first disable the network, and then attempt to remove it (if SSID is passed)
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.disconnect(ssid)
 *  ```
 *  - `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)
 *  - `ssid` is **OPTIONAL** .. if not passed, will disconnect current WiFi (almost all Android versions now will just automatically reconnect to last wifi after disconnecting)
 *  - If `ssid` is provided, this method will first attempt to `disable` and then `remove` the network
 *  - If you do not want to remove network configuration, use `disable` instead
 *
 *  Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  - `DISCONNECT_NET_REMOVE_ERROR` Android returned error when removing wifi configuration
 *  - `DISCONNECT_NET_DISABLE_ERROR` Unable to connect based on generated wifi config
 *  - `DISCONNECT_NET_ID_NOT_FOUND` Unable to determine network ID to disconnect/remove (from passed SSID)
 *  - `ERROR_DISCONNECT` - Android error disconnecting wifi (only when SSID is not passed)
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.formatWifiConfig(ssid, password, algorithm, isHiddenSSID)
 *  ```
 *  - `algorithm` and `password` is not required if connecting to an open network
 *  - Currently `WPA` and `WEP` are only supported algorithms
 *  - For `WPA2` just pass `WPA` as the algorithm
 *  - Set `isHiddenSSID` to `true` if the network you're connecting to is hidden
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.formatWPAConfig(ssid, password, isHiddenSSID)
 *  ```
 *  - This is just a helper method that calls `WifiWizard2.formatWifiConfig( ssid, password, 'WPA', isHiddenSSID );`
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.add(wifi)
 *  ```
 *  - `wifi` must be an object formatted by `formatWifiConfig`, this **must** be done before calling `enable`
 *
 *  Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  - `AUTH_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORTED` - Invalid auth type specified
 *  - `ERROR_ADDING_NETWORK` - Android returned `-1` specifying error adding network
 *  - `ERROR_UPDATING_NETWORK` - Same as above, except an existing network ID was found, and unable to update it
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.remove(ssid)
 *  ```
 *  - `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)
 *  - Please note, most newer versions of Android will only allow wifi to be removed if created by your application
 *
 *  Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  - `UNABLE_TO_REMOVE` Android returned failure in removing network
 *  - `REMOVE_NETWORK_NOT_FOUND` Unable to determine network ID from passed SSID
 *
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.listNetworks()
 *  ```
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.scan([options])
 *  ```
 *  - Same as calling `startScan` and then `getScanResults`, except this method will only resolve the promise after the scan completes and returns the results.
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.startScan()
 *  ```
 *  - It is recommended to just use the `scan` method instead of `startScan`
 *
 *  Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  - `STARTSCAN_FAILED` Android returned failure in starting scan
 *
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.getScanResults([options])
 *  ```
 *  - `getScanResults` should only be called after calling `startScan` (it is recommended to use `scan` instead as this starts the scan, then returns the results)
 *  - `[options]` is optional, if you do not want to specify, just pass `success` callback as first parameter, and `fail` callback as second parameter
 *  - Retrieves a list of the available networks as an array of objects and passes them to the function listHandler. The format of the array is:
 *  ```typescript
 *  networks = [
 *  {   "level": signal_level, // raw RSSI value
 *         "SSID": ssid, // SSID as string, with escaped double quotes: "\"ssid name\""
 *         "BSSID": bssid // MAC address of WiFi router as string
 *         "frequency": frequency of the access point channel in MHz
 *         "capabilities": capabilities // Describes the authentication, key management, and encryption schemes supported by the access point.
 *         "timestamp": timestamp // timestamp of when the scan was completed
 *         "channelWidth":
 *         "centerFreq0":
 *         "centerFreq1":
 *     }
 *  ]
 *  ```
 *  - `channelWidth` `centerFreq0` and `centerFreq1` are only supported on API > 23 (Marshmallow), any older API will return null for these values
 *
 *  An options object may be passed. Currently, the only supported option is `numLevels`, and it has the following behavior:
 *
 *  - if `(n == true || n < 2)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will return data as before, split in 5 levels;
 *  - if `(n > 1)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will calculate the signal level, split in n levels;
 *  - if `(n == false)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will use the raw signal level;
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.isWifiEnabled()
 *  ```
 *  - Returns boolean value of whether Wifi is enabled or not
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.setWifiEnabled(enabled)
 *  ```
 *  - Pass `true` for `enabled` parameter to set Wifi enabled
 *  - You do not need to call this function to set WiFi enabled to call other methods that require wifi enabled.  This plugin will automagically enable WiFi if a method is called that requires WiFi to be enabled.
 *
 *  Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  - `ERROR_SETWIFIENABLED` wifi state does not match call (enable or disable)
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.getConnectedNetworkID()
 *  ```
 *  - Returns currently connected network ID in success callback (only if connected), otherwise fail callback will be called
 *
 *  **Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  - `GET_CONNECTED_NET_ID_ERROR` Unable to determine currently connected network ID (may not be connected)
 *
 *  ## New to 3.1.1+
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.resetBindAll()
 *  ```
 *  - Disable bindAll to WiFi network without disconnecting from WiFi
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.setBindAll()
 *  ```
 *  - Enable bindAll to WiFi network without disconnecting from WiFi
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.canConnectToInternet()
 *  ```
 *
 *  - Returns boolean, true or false, if device is able to connect to https://www.google.com via HTTP connection (since ping is unreliable)
 *  - Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions
 *  - If you called `connect` or `enable` and passed `true` for `bindAll`, your application will force the ping through wifi connection.
 *  - If you did not pass `true` (or passed `false`) for `bindAll`, and the wifi does not have internet connection, Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) will use cell connection to ping (due to Android using cell connection when wifi does not have internet) [More Details](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)
 *
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.canConnectToRouter()
 *  ```
 *  - As `canPingWifiRouter` is notoriously unreliable, this method uses HTTP connection to test if able to connect to router (as most routers should have web server running on port 80)
 *  - Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions
 *  - This is useful for testing to make sure that your Android app is able to connect to the private network after connecting to WiFi
 *  - This was added for testing the `bindAll` feature to support issues with Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) not routing calls through WiFi if WiFi does not have internet connection [See Android Blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)
 *  - Attempts to connect router IP HTTP server on port 80 (example: `http://192.168.0.1/` where `192.168.0.1` is the automatically detected IP address)
 *
 *  ## New to 3.0.0+
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.isConnectedToInternet()
 *  ```
 *
 *  - Returns boolean, true or false, if device is able to ping 8.8.8.8
 *  - Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions
 *  - If you called `connect` or `enable` and passed `true` for `bindAll`, your application will force the ping through wifi connection.
 *  - If you did not pass `true` (or passed `false`) for `bindAll`, and the wifi does not have internet connection, Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) will use cell connection to ping (due to Android using cell connection when wifi does not have internet) [More Details](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.canPingWifiRouter()
 *  ```
 *
 *  - Returns boolean, true or false, if device is able to ping the connected WiFi router IP (obtained from DHCP info)
 *  - Version 3.1.1+ uses HTTP connection to test if able to connect to router (as ping previous did not work)
 *  - Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions
 *  - This is useful for testing to make sure that your Android app is able to connect to the private network after connecting to WiFi
 *  - This was added for testing the `bindAll` feature to support issues with Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) not routing calls through WiFi if WiFi does not have internet connection [See Android Blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.enableWifi()
 *  ```
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.disableWifi()
 *  ```
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.getWifiIP()
 *  ```
 *  - Returns IPv4 address of currently connected WiFi, or rejects promise if IP not found or wifi not connected
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.getWifiRouterIP()
 *  ```
 *  - Returns IPv4 WiFi router IP from currently connected WiFi, or rejects promise if unable to determine, or wifi not connected
 *
 *  **Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  - `NO_VALID_IP_IDENTIFIED` if unable to determine a valid IP (ip returned from device is `0.0.0.0`)
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.getWifiIPInfo()
 *  ```
 *  - Returns a JSON object with IPv4 address and subnet `{"ip": "192.168.1.2", "subnet": "255.255.255.0" }` or rejected promise if not found or not connected
 *  **Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  - `NO_VALID_IP_IDENTIFIED` if unable to determine a valid IP (ip returned from device is `0.0.0.0`)
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.reconnect()
 *  ```
 *  - Reconnect to the currently active access point, **if we are currently disconnected.**
 *
 *  **Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  - `ERROR_RECONNECT` Android returned error when reconnecting
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.reassociate()
 *  ```
 *  - Reconnect to the currently active access point, **even if we are already connected.**
 *
 *  **Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  - `ERROR_REASSOCIATE` Android returned error when reassociating
 *
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.getSSIDNetworkID(ssid)
 *  ```
 *  - Get Android Network ID from passed SSID
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.disable(ssid)
 *  ```
 *  - `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)
 *  - Disable the passed SSID network
 *  - Please note that most newer versions of Android will only allow you to disable networks created by your application
 *
 *  **Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  - `UNABLE_TO_DISABLE` Android returned failure in disabling network
 *  - `DISABLE_NETWORK_NOT_FOUND` Unable to determine network ID from passed SSID to disable
 *
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.requestPermission()
 *  ```
 *  - Request `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permssion
 *  - This Android permission is required to run `scan`, `startStart` and `getScanResults`
 *  - You can request permission by running this function manually, or WifiWizard2 will automagically request permission when one of the functions above is called
 *
 *  **Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  - `PERMISSION_DENIED` user denied permission on device
 *
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  this.wifiWizard2.enable(ssid, bindAll, waitForConnection)
 *  ```
 *  - `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)
 *  - `bindAll` should be set to `true` to tell Android to route all connections from your Android app, through the wifi connection
 *  - Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) will not route connections to the WiFi device if it does not have internet connection.  Passing `true` to `bindAll` will force Android to route connections from your Android app through Wifi, regardless of internet connection.
 *  - If you are having problems connecting to a local IP through WiFi because it does not have internet, try enabling `bindAll` and this should fix the problem.
 *  - During my testing, some versions of Android (5.0 - 7.1.2) would still route connections through WiFi without internet, but it was random that some versions would and would not work.
 *  - Testing Android Oreo+ (8.0.0+) if wifi does not have internet, 100% of the time it would NOT route connections through WiFi, so you *must* enable this for Oreo or newer to route connections from your application through wifi without internet.
 *  - When `bindAll` is enabled, *ALL* connections from your app will be routed through WiFi, until you call `disconnect` or `disable`
 *  - See the Google Android Blog for [More Details](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)
 *  - This feature *ONLY* works for Android Lollipop+ (API 21+), if device is running API older than 21, `bindall` will be ignored (as API older than 21 does this by default)
 *  - Enable the passed SSID network
 *  - You **MUST** call `WifiWizard2.add(wifi)` before calling `enable` as the wifi configuration must exist before you can enable it (or previously used `connect` without calling `disconnect`)
 *  - This method does NOT wait or verify connection to wifi network, pass `true` to `waitForConnection` to only return promise once connection is verified in COMPLETED state to specific `ssid`
 *
 *  **Thrown Errors**
 *
 *  `UNABLE_TO_ENABLE` - Android returned `-1` signifying failure enabling
