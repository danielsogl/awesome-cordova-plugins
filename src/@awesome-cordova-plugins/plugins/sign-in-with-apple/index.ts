 * Sign in with Apple makes it easy for users to sign in to your apps and websites using their Apple ID.
 * Instead of filling out forms, verifying email addresses, and choosing new passwords,

 * All accounts are protected with two-factor authentication for superior security,
 * and Apple will not track users’ activity in your app or website.
 * Source:* https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/
