   *
   * In iOS, the amount of datapoints is limited to 1000 by default.
   * You can override this by adding a limit: xxx to your query object.
   * In iOS, datapoints are ordered in an descending fashion (from newer to older).
   * You can revert this behaviour by adding ascending: true to your query object.
   * In Android, it is possible to query for "raw" steps or to select those as filtered by the Google Fit app.
   * In the latter case the query object must contain the field filtered: true.
   * In Google Fit, calories.basal is returned as an average per day, and usually is not available in all days.
   * In Google Fit, calories.active is computed by subtracting the basal calories from the total.
   * As basal energy expenditure, an average is computed from the week before endDate.
   * While Google Fit calculates basal and active calories automatically,
   * HealthKit needs an explicit input from some app.
   * When querying for activities, Google Fit is able to determine some activities automatically
   * (still, walking, running, biking, in vehicle), while HealthKit only relies on the input of
   * the user or of some external app.
   * When querying for activities, calories and distance are also provided in HealthKit (units are kcal and meters) and
   * never in Google Fit.
   * When querying for nutrition, Google Fit always returns all the nutrition elements it has,
   * while HealthKit returns only those that are stored as correlation. To be sure to get all stored the quantities
   * (regardless of they are stored as correlation or not), it's better to query single nutrients.
   * nutrition.vitamin_a is given in micrograms in HealthKit and International Unit in Google Fit.
   * Automatic conversion is not trivial and depends on the actual substance.

   * Quirks of queryAggregated()

   * true must be added into the query object.
   * When querying for activities, calories and distance are provided
   * when available in HealthKit and never in Google Fit.
   * In Android, the start and end dates returned are the date of the first and the last available samples.
   * If no samples are found, start and end may not be set.
   * When bucketing, buckets will include the whole hour / day / month / week / year where start and end times
