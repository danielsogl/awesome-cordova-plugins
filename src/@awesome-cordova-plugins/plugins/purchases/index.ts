/**
 * @name Purchases
 * @description
 * Purchases* is a client for the [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) subscription and purchase tracking system.
 * It is an open source framework that provides a wrapper around `BillingClient`, `StoreKit` and the RevenueCat backend
 * to make implementing in-app subscriptions easy - receipt validation and status tracking included!
 *

 *
 * ## Capacitor
 *
 * The Cordova plugin is not guaranteed to be up to date and we are moving our efforts to the Capacitor plugin.
 * Please consider using our [Capacitor plugin](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/capacitor) instead of the Cordova plugin and this wrapper.
 *
 * ## Getting Started
 *
 * Please follow the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/) for more information on how to use the SDK
 *
 * ## Latest changes to this plugin
 *
 * This latest release updates the plugin to use BillingClient 6 in Android. If you come from an older version of the
 * RevenueCat SDK, see [Android Native - 5.x to 6.x Migration](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/android-native-5x-to-6x-migration)
 * for a more thorough explanation of the new Google subscription model announced with BillingClient 5 and how to take advantage of it.
 *
 * If your app supports product changes using [DEFERRED replacement mode](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/managing-subscriptions#google-play),
 * then you can either stick with the previous major version until support for DEFERRED is re-introduced in this major version,
 * or you can remove DEFERRED replacement options from your app.
 * @usage
 *
 * ### Requirements
 * Requires XCode 13.2+ and minimum target iOS 11.0+
 * This plugin has been tested with cordova-plugin-purchases@5.x.x
 * @interfaces
 * PurchasesError
 * IntroEligibility
 * UpgradeInfo
 * PurchasesOfferings
 * PurchasesOffering
 * PurchasesPackage
 * PurchasesStoreProduct
 * CustomerInfo
