Purchases* is a client for the [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) subscription and purchase tracking system.
It is an open source framework that provides a wrapper around `BillingClient`, `StoreKit` and the RevenueCat backend
to make implementing in-app subscriptions easy - receipt validation and status tracking included!

## Capacitor

The Cordova plugin is not guaranteed to be up to date and we are moving our efforts to the Capacitor plugin.
Please consider using our [Capacitor plugin](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/capacitor) instead of the Cordova plugin and this wrapper.

## Getting Started

Please follow the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/) for more information on how to use the SDK

## Latest changes to this plugin

This latest release updates the plugin to use BillingClient 6 in Android. If you come from an older version of the
RevenueCat SDK, see [Android Native - 5.x to 6.x Migration](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/android-native-5x-to-6x-migration)
for a more thorough explanation of the new Google subscription model announced with BillingClient 5 and how to take advantage of it.

If your app supports product changes using [DEFERRED replacement mode](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/managing-subscriptions#google-play),
then you can either stick with the previous major version until support for DEFERRED is re-introduced in this major version,
or you can remove DEFERRED replacement options from your app.

## Supported platforms

- Android
  - iOS
